# Touch Screen Interface   
Codes used for the touch screen interface. The main sections are:

## Get touch screen position data

<pre> ros2 run mouse_tracker mouse_publisher  </pre>

The python code used can be found at the repository under mouse_publisher.py

P.S. Make sure to select "Ubuntu on Xorg" in the settings on the Ubuntu login screen. The position tracker does not function properly with Wayland, it only works over web pages and not across the entire screen due to security restrictions.
